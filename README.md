# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Sample Application #

This is the sample application for [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

I am developing this application to get a good handle on TDD and BDD, as well as the deeper intricacies of Rails.

This is effectively a twitter clone.  Key tasks are  rolling authentication and authorization from scratch, leading with development with TDD by writing rspec tests for each component and following with writing BDD style integration tests.

# Features Implemented #

* User authentication/authorization* User authentication/authorization 
* Unique username/email/password
* Microposts model
* Following/Follower Relationships
* Micropost Replies
* Compass designed UI
* Jquery interruptions
