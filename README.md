# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is the sample application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

I am working through this to get a good handle on TDD and BDD, as well as the deeper intricacies of Rails.

The tutorial leads through building a twitter clone.  Key tasks are  rolling authentication and authorization from scratch, leading with development with TDD by writing rspec tests for each component and following with writing BDD style integration tests.
